<p>Payment is made in cash during the journey.<br><br>
 We recommend that you arrange to have the payment ready for the journey in advance.<BR><BR> Preferably in the exact amount in cash if possible, as this will avoid the need to find a cash machine.<br><br> 
Or to find change if the car owner doesn't have any.
